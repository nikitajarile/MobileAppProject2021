Proposed Project Idea:  Women Safety App

1.	What is/are the problem/s you want to solve? Please provide background based on research. 
With each passing day the crime rate is increasing rapidly, the safety and security of women has become a greater concern than ever before in today’s world. According to one survey, 81% of women have faced some sort of serious harassment, before puberty.
From domestic violence to violent crime outside the home, various situations have pushed many women into a corner where they lose the confidence one needs to face the outside world. Fortunately, many countries are trying to do something about the problem. What if I told you we can help? What if I told you smartphone apps, and their developers, could be part of the solution? And so we this thought, we bring to you a women safety app "BraveU"

2.	Who are the users you are targeting? Please use a Persona to describe your users and draw a picture of your target user. 
This app is targeting working women like Amy who has to travels 2 hours everyday. She often comes home alone at late scary night. For safety of such women, this app can be very beneficial  

3.	What are the major features of the solution? List the features.
Core Functionality :
This app will have the ability to share your location with friends and family, in real-time and also ability to notify friends and family that the user has safely made it to wherever they were going. We also want to include the ability to call for police or medical assistance, live tracking system to keep a record of your last location,provide the provision to mark a safe or unsafe location to intimate other women,add the provision to record audio and video clips in-app and send it to the user’s SOS contacts, as every second is essential in case of emergencies.

4.	How is this solution unique? How does it relate to existing solutions on the market? What are three solutions similar or related to what you want to do in the Google Play Store? Do the research and know that you are probably not reinventing the wheel! Present these three solutions, a description and how they compare to yours. Provide screenshots of the existing solutions.
There are many safety apps in the Market right now like SoSecure, Life360, SHESafe. Most of the app just have either SOS calling or messaging and GPS tracker. There is no real time availablity of any feature that can aware them before or to get the recemt GPS location. Motivated by this we are including live tracking system to keep a record of your last location,provide the provision to mark a safe or unsafe location to intimate other women,add the provision to record audio and video clips in-app

5.	What technologies, APIs etc will you be using to develop this solution? Provide links and explanations.
This requirement includes:
Android operating System.
Java, Kotlin as a core language.
